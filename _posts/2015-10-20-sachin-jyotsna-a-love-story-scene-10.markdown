I must have told him long back. At least I must have told him in person. I saved the story to be told and laughed at, together. Not for this. I didn't hear from him after the day I mailed him what happened on my birthday. 

Life became hollow all of a sudden. Walking on the street, I felt like I am alone, standing in the middle of sub-way with so many people around. I wrote so many mails. I flooded his office mail box too. He didn't reply. There is always one person I can run into, at any kind of crisis in life. Appa :) . He read my eyes. He didn't talk about it. Wherever I am down, he immediately takes me out. Just him and me. We walked in the sea without speaking a word. Even if everybody in the world would fail, there would be one person who would be waiting for me with open shoulders, and that's my dad! 

I figured out it was Feb 14 the next day. City was all red. Balloons, lights, decorations, all in red. Bessie was flooded by couples. 'Out' wasn't working great. Dad tried food. Murugan idly kadai and its wonderful idlys. I filled my stomach. Still didn't work. Father took me home. Mom prepared coffee, still didn't work. She then cleaned my room up and set the bed up ready. I wanted to check my mail box once. No mails from him. I rushed to my bed, locked my room, cuddled up my pillow and slept tight. 

My mobile woke me up. I answered the call. "Jyo!" The same warm voice. It was him. It was him. "Sachin?"
"Ya it's me. Can you get ready? I will pick you up in 1 hour from the fifth Street."
I cried. Out of happiness. Most wonderful moment. I was excited as much as a school kid would be on first day of the summer long vacation. I got ready. The Tyndall effect at the window curtain, agarbatti fragrance from mom's pooja room, sulamangalam sister's voices singing kanda shashti kavasam in surround. Just the kind of fresh start to the day i could ever get. Was hyper excited in dine table. Kissed mom. Hugged dad. Ran to fifth Street. Sachin was already waiting in his car. I went and sat in. We both looked each other. He said "Hi". I said " Hi!". The eyes spoke the rest. I gave him a hug. It lasted for little more than half a minute. He asked me, "Shall we go?". I was speechless. " Yes!".

He drove me towards ECR. I asked him, "Your workshop is over?".
He said, "No". 
" What??? Then how come in Chennai?"
"Long story short, just wanted to meet you once"
"You are a magician!" I smiled. He was indeed the magician. I couldn't see him. I thought I would cry. I kept staring outside window, loving the breeze and sun, like the first vacation trip for a school kid. 

He took me to a private beach. I have been there once, when I was 12 years old. With my dad. He stopped the car, came out running, opened the door for me, like a servant, like I am his queen. I went out, straight to the beach. He parked the car and followed me. I was flying high. Wanted to settle down. Watched the sea, and the sun light sparkling over bay of Bengal. Then I realised he was hiding something behind. I asked him what. 
"Happy belated birthday." It was a bouquet with 23 roses in it. My cheeks weakened. Eyes got wet. "These 23 roses are for the 23 beautiful years you have made this world look beautiful." I took the bouquet from him. He gave another single rose. "This rose is for the next 40 days, for this stupid making it late". I cried. I hugged him. The sun, the sea, and him. This time the hug lasted for more than a few minutes. Then I was holding his hand and staring at the sea and thanking God for giving this wonderful moment. The world was looking like, as if it is existing only for us. 

We then did everything spontaneously. "Pasta" I would say, and we would go for Italian cuisine restaurant. "Bowling" he would say, we went to play bowling in Mall. "Ice-colo" I would say, we would go to the kulfi shop. We lived the day like living a whole life together. Then he said, "I have to board my flight in night. So I would drop you home now." The sun was falling and it started to rain. There was traffic. "Sachin? Some music?" I asked him. "Ya sure. Open the CD book and play the 4th disk". It was written Raja Sir Volume 3. First song was 'Oh butterfly'. Rain. Evening. Traffic. That song. Me and Him. "Thanks a lot traffic, please extend this journey"

We were near my house. He said, "Well! I hope you are happy. Sorry for not replying for your mails. We will meet again." 
"When?"
"Soon. Just couple more weeks."
Silence. I was very happy. But there was some incompleteness.
"Bye" he whispered. 
"Bye". 
I got out of the car. He pulled me back into the car and whispered, " 9486075474". 
"You have got a phone?"
"Yes!" He showed his phone.
Best possible gift! He is changed. He diluted his principles in life for me. He has stepped in a few miles closer today. For me. He managed to surprise me, despite being very far. His eyes had a gravity, which made me fly. First gravity in world to disprove newton's law. It was Love! At its purest form. 

As I was looking into his eyes, it rained again. It locked me up in car again. Now I had a gravitational pull towards him. He came closer to me. I allowed him to come closer. There was exchange of breathe. There was exchange of heat. Our heart beats synchronised. 
And then, we Kissed!!

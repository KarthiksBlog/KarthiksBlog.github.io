I had a girl friend during my graduation days. Things were so beautiful between us, until the day we both confessed the love to each other. The later part of that love story had the following words: expectations, desperation, longing, depression, insanity, emotional black mailing, and lastly "break up". 

Though Jyotsna and I were in love, we both managed our days without explicit confessions. But people around us were getting more curious and restless. That was putting us into trouble and embarrassments most times. We had added-up complications in our story like, she was a Hindu brahmin, I was a Christian. And beyond all this, I wanted to get rid of the mobile phone in my life. Hence one fine day we came up with a plan. " Sachin, you should come to my house and talk to my father about us. I will go to your home and talk to your parents", she said. That was sounding great. We both knew the likes and dislikes of our parents. 

I was getting a call from Roshan, "machaa, I am coming to Chennai this Sunday" 
"Great da! Wow! What's up?"
"We are performing at the meridian." 
Something struck me hard. Mahesh loves Jazz!!!! 
"You are the best Roshan! I love you I love you I love you."
"Hahaa what happened machaa"
"Can you get me a couple of tickets?"
"Of course machaa! I am inviting you!!"
"Super! I will call you right back"
I disconnected Roshan and dialled Alan. "Hi machaa, what's up?"
"Dei, can I borrow your bullet for a day? This Sunday?"
"Dei, athukkulla innoru figure ah? What happened to Jyotsna?"
"If I you are next to me right now, you will shed blood on your nose"
"Well, alright! I was joking machaan. You can take it."
"Thanks a lot da! Can I also have it on Saturday?"
"Well, sure but why?"
"To have a service done in prior. " 

Well that's everything falling into place. I then dialled up Jyotsna to check whether Mahesh is free on Sunday. He was free. She planned her tickets on Saturday night to go to my home. 

I had prepared scripts on what to speak, what not to speak. Father of each girl would look for somebody who can look after their girl like them! When I mean like them, its the most difficult thing on earth! Like how they carried her over their shoulders and ran to make her win each time, be it a race or be it life. Mahesh would expect me to be that guy. I wanted to convince that I can take care of Jyotsna better than him. 

Sunday arrived. I had gone to their home in afternoon. Mahesh was watching highlights of a old English test match, in which Dravid would carry his bat after a lone man century. Aunty showed a bit of hesitation at my arrival. Mahesh welcomed me with a smile and a tight hand shake. 
"Please come in Sachin."
Then he went into the kitchen, after a long murmuring chat with Jyotsna's mom, he came back and said "give me 10 minutes, I will be back after a shower."
"Sure take your time uncle." 
He then threw the TV remote to me, "please feel free to change channel. Feel like your home, son" he said. 
I was least interested in TV. I then scanned the TV room and all the photographs on wall. It was full of Jyotsna. Her every single moment in life was freezed into photo frame. Birthdays, dance arangetram, sports wins, competition wins, her friends circle, her childhood, her portraits, beach moments, family portraits. "I can never become Mahesh", I told to myself. 
When he said 10minutes, he was out in 8 minutes and a few seconds. "I can never become Mahesh", I repeated. 

He was totally delighted to see the classic 350. I then gave him the keys and asked him to drive. He was double delighted. We drove, drove and drove long. Initially he was a bit nasty. Then he became stable in driving. He drove me to Pondicherry. We went to beach. Sat on those rocks. Starred at the sea for long time. Didn't speak a word. Then drove to ashram there. He looked for some books. Bought a couple. Then we started back. While coming back, we took turns in driving. We stopped everywhere for a tea or tender coconut. We talked politics, philosophies, cricket. 

When we were reaching Chennai, I drove him to Meridian. He asked me, " Why to meridian? Let's go home for dinner. I will ask Priya to prepare something". 
"Surprise uncle! Ask Aunty not to prepare anything. You are going to enjoy the evening"
When we entered meridian, he made a call. The call took a while. I was afraid that her mom isn't happy about me. As soon as we entered the concert hall, Mahesh showed his excitement in a loud voice, "Woooow! You made my day, Son!". They had several round tables with seats around. Roshan had booked a couple of seats for us, very near to the stage. They were serving drinks. Mahesh was hyper excited. He socialised with table mates so easily. They went on for a toast, after each track. He enjoyed every bit of it. He was literally living his day. A 50 year old man could drive all the way back and forth to Pondicherry in classic 350 in a single day and he could party the same night. He had so much energy! More than everything, he was doing every possible thing as if he will have no regrets at all. "I think Jyotsna likes me because I am a small reflection of Mahesh" I told to myself. 

Roshan took the mike and said, "this is our last song. We are dedicating this one for our special friend, Mahesh". It was a couple of ARR's songs in Jazz style, Mahesh is a big fan of ARR, especially his early music in 90s. It was all planned. Mahesh was put in tears. He came to me and hugged me tight. " I think I made it", I told to myself. 

We came out. It was 12 midnight. Mahesh asked me for bike key. He could barely stand. He was high. I asked him to sit at the back. I dropped him home. He thanked me for the day. He was drunk. I was in two minds. 'Is this the better time to ask him, if I can marry his daughter', my mind was fighting. The whole day I couldn't speak a single word about his daughter. "Jyotsna is gonna kill me", I told myself. He then came back. " Sachin, I need to book a tatkal ticket tomorrow. Heard from Jyo that you are good at it. Can you come home in morning? ". The first request from my father in law. " sure uncle! "

Thiru is out of station. But I was confident. I reached back Jyotsna's house at 9 next day. Mahesh was up. We sat with computer at 9:30. I felt like student taking his test without his master for first time. I did everything right. Logged in at 9:50. Waited till 10. Browsed for trains. Made clicks with patience. Everything was going fine, till payment page. Then Mata IRCTC stopped to respond. I waited, waited and waited. Then she said, "Sorry, you have clicked refresh or back or you have left the page idle for longtime. You need to re-login". I felt like throwing the monitor out of the window. " those were the bloody three things possible things anybody on earth could do", I yelled at computer. Aunty peeped in. "Everything is OK?". " ya Aunty! " already she hates me. On top of it, this! 

I did re-login. It was waiting list 27 already! I lost the test! My first test! Frustrations were building up. Mahesh was taking a shower. "How am I going to face him? How am I going to face Jyotsna?". Then Mahesh came into the room. When I was about to apologise, he said, " Thanks man! Incredible! You have booked a 3rd AC ticket! Impossible stuff ", looking at his mobile. THIRUUUU :) I had texted the details to my master anyways as a back up. I wasn't sure, whether he was in a place to access Internet. Thiru is my God father! 

I was about to leave and I heard Aunty murmuring something to uncle. I peeped into the kitchen to say a bye. She was saying, " did you confirm with him that the wedding should be in Brahmin style? ". 
Friends!! This is the moment of my life!!!!! 

They then became conscious of my presence. There was silence. I said bye to them. Then Mahesh walked along with me to send me off. He put his hand over my shoulders and said, " a few months back, my daughter was unhappy. She had something going on in her mind. Myself and Priya, we never question her personal conflicts. She share it when it's necessary for her. That's how we have brought her up. That was a well one week. She refused to share anything at all. We both tried our best to cheer her. We failed at doing it for first ever time in our life. Then one fine day she became happy all of a sudden. After that, till today I see my daughter with all smiles!"
He paused for a while. I was getting nervous! 
"I came to know that, he had gone out that day to meet a gentleman! Since then, I was waiting for this one day you would come to me and have a word!"
I was speechless! He looked at my face. Started smiling! 
"Will you marry my daughter? Because I believe she will be happy living a life with you"

I didn't cry! I felt proud. Earning a girl's love is hard. Earning her father's respect is harder. I hugged him tight. Though in corner of my mind, I was still afraid that my parents would refuse a Hindu way of wedding. Mahesh continued, "Don't worry about Priya! You guys plan your wedding. I can convince my wife to come to church. My daughter's happiness is important to me than my social and cultural status." 

My friends. I am at extreme emotions now. Waiting at the station to receive Jyotsna. Its clear on my side. Her side story would decide the result. My parents are the tough ones. Fingers crossed!

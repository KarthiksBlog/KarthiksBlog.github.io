He dropped me at central. It's a long journey. "Sothappidaadha chellame", he said with puppy face. I gave him a hug and said " same to you chellame!". Train started to move. I was getting nervous. Sachin's parents are difficult ones. They were always strict at him. More than how my parents accept him, his parents should accept me. That's how it works here in south India. 

We had shopped the whole day on Saturday. I had bought sarees for Aunty and party wear shirt, dhoties for uncle. Uncle likes the ghee mysoorpa from Krishna. I had bought a couple of boxes of it. I was carrying the only half saree I had, to wear at their place. Aunty loves half saree. I know about my father. He respects my decisions in life. His meeting with Sachin will be a sort of formality thing. I was worrying too much about mine. The sunshine woke me up from train window. I saw gaint windmills on both side of the train. It was a beautiful scene. I wished he was with me. Freshened up. Took a coffee. And was waiting for my station. 

Nagerkoil :) such a beautiful city. Fresh morning. I followed Sachin's instructions. His town is a little bit away from city. I took a town bus. And got down at 'paala karai' stop. There was a huge banyan tree like he had mentioned. I walked straight towards it and crossed the tree on its left. Then proceeded in the mud road under canopy of trees on both side of road. Then finally i found the lake. There was auto drivers. As I was getting closer, they started welcoming me. Such a good smile and warm look that you can never find in any auto driver back in my city. I was giving him the address. He said he knew where to drop. It was a small but lovely village. It had shades of Kerala. Weather was optimum. 

We reached Sachin's house. It was a small house with Mangalore tiles. I paid auto driver. He didn't take the money from me and told me that uncle paid him in morning, on his way to church. As I was stepping inside his house, I was hearing kids singing. The music was coming from right corner of the house. I slowly walked towards it. It was Aunty singing along with bunch of kids. They were singing the carnatic Raag 'Gambeera Naattai". I stood there at doorstep with my eyes closed and embraced the music. It was a lovely and peaceful sound. It was 25 minutes straight. Then there was a silence. The kids were all starring at me. Aunty asked kids to continue singing and came out of the room. They continued with 'kaanada'. She welcomed me with a kind of smile. It was the most purest face I have ever seen in life. She touched my head with her palm, and enquired how the train journey was. 

She took me to a room. It was Sachin's room. It had a lot of his childhood stuff, photos, cups he had won. She made me comfortable. I went for bath. As I was getting back, I could hear uncle's voice. Kids kept singing. I came out after dressing up. Aunty looked at me and stood still for a moment. I smiled at her. Uncle came by her and they both smiled at me. Half saree worked. :)

Uncle was 5 times as talkative as Sachin. He told all stories about his church choir. He was a baryton singer. No wonder why Sachin's voice is so warm. Then I met one interesting girl. 'Pammi'. She was simply the village kid. She was the daughter of their maid. Aunty introduced her and said, "Kannaa, you can have breakfast and then Pammi would take you out. You can go to the farms here. Village sight seeing. Your cities won't have such good places. She will then bring you back for lunch." 

Pammi was 10 times as talkative as Sachin. But she had sweet voice. We met so many people on our way. She introduced everyone to me. They all had a special respect for Uncle. The whole village was like a family. Everybody knew each other very well. Unlike the high and wide apartments in cities where we don't know our neighbours well. Farms, well, nature. The day was turning out to be magical. There was a swing tied up in one of those trees. I became a kid and began to play. Pammi pushed me from behind. Her cristal laughs were adding the flavour to my joy. I was at my peak of energy. 

We then returned back. She came to me and with her loud tone, told me "Akka neenga romba azhagaa irukkeenga" (you look very beautiful). People are so open there. Sachin is simply a part of that village. I couldn't resist myself from kissing her. When I returned home, the kids were all leaving. One kid asked Aunty, "Intha Akka yaaru?" (Who is this?). Aunty told them, "She is your Athai. She is going to marry Sachin Mama". 
Sometimes language is too limited to express our emotions. Lovely lovely moment it was. I stood there speechless. The kids all shouted in love, " Hai Athaiiii". 

I didn't speak a word. I was trying to control my tears. They served lunch. It wasn't food. It was simply the solidified form of love. I had hickups in between. Uncle ran to bring water while aunty tried to rub at my back. They were struggling to get rid of Hickups I had. Love. Simply love. Everything was Ultaa! Unexpectedly beautiful! Like a rain in mid of hot month of April. 

Then I took a nap. The last time I slept so peacefully was probably when I was a kid. Aunty woke me up again in evening. Asked me to get ready for my train. I gave them sarees and shirts and all the gifts I had bought for them. They were very happy. Hyper excited. I gave one box of sweets to Pammi. It was time to leave. 

Before leaving I fell over their feet to get their blessing. When I stood up again, I saw aunty crying. I couldn't control my tears anymore. "I can't believe uncle", I whispered. "Did Sachin threaten you too much about us? We showed strictness in bringing him up, because he should be truthful and honest to people. But we love him and trust him. We knew that you would be a nice girl. We simply knew. Because it was his choice.", he said. " do visit us often. Bring him next time when you come. " aunty continued. 
"I promise aunty!". 

Auto was waiting for me. Uncle helped me put my bag in auto. He paid the driver and asked him to drop me directly in junction. Then he came to me and spoke a few final words, " we are Christians. But we don't mind your culture. You can see, aunty loves carnatic music. She is a trained singer and she teaches class. We only don't have a krishna photo at our place. If there are any troubles at your side because of this fact, tell me. I would try to speak with your family. Because, you guys must live long together. That's our wish. " 

I was speechless. I wanted to win their heart. But I got defeated by their overwhelming love. On the way to junction, auto driver spoke few words. He said, uncle and aunty are feeling a bit lonely since Sachin visits them rarely these days. I made him a promise that I would bring Sachin soon again. 

Sometimes I feel I don't deserve such good moments in life. It is one of those times. Sachin was waiting in central to receive me with a curious face. I simply hugged him. Hug lasted for nearly 5 minutes. I cried. He was in smile. He understood the tears were out of happiness. I began to speak.
"You know why everything is falling into place?"
"Because you are a lovely girl and you deserve it" he said. 
"No. It's not for us. But for those lovely people who gave birth to us. They deserve this story of love in their life." 
We had smile. It was full. I couldn't believe any moment which happened in past few days of life. Right from the day I met Sachin, to this day. Things happened as beautiful as metaphorical poems. I was wondering, when love is this much beautiful, why would even people write songs on break ups and hatred. 

We were on his car. Getting back to my place. The second most beautiful Monday of my life. There was just silence. As if a silence after a storm. As we were entering our house, there were lot of horoscopes lying on the table in middle of hall. 
I got a shock out of trauma. Sachin was holding my hand tightly and asked me, "What happened Jyo?"




"Mala aunty!!!"

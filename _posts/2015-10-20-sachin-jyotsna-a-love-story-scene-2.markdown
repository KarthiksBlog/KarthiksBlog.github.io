Today I have called him to take me out. I have never been out with any guy alone. This is all new for me.

He said he has a car. I am so afraid about bikes. I must have let him come in his car. "Why did I ask for a bike ride then? " because he likes drama in life. I am sure he will borrow one from his friends.

He is so transparent. He opens up so easily. I struggle to speak. I fear embarrassments. I fear people. But he is simply funny. He doesn't give a shit about people's opinions and ideas. 

We work together. He is smart and extremely calm at workplace. He is the kind of guy, every new girl in the team would like to get mentored under. He often tries to be nice to people. But there are smartasses in team who put him into embarrassment. What do you do when somebody embarrass you so much? And make others laugh at you? I will kill the guy 10 times in my mind with minimum 5 different weapons. He simply talks about his ignorance which put him into embarrassment, he talks about it so many times that he can come over it. He also talks in a way that multiplies people's laughter and smile.

His voice has got a warmth. I love to listen to him speak. We hardly get time to talk though. But everytime he was around, he is the one who speaks more. I let him speak more. There are occasions he would ask me questions, I give him one line answer. I would think "what is so interesting about me to tell him". He doesn't own a mobile phone. People make fun of him. They say, he is from a different time frame, a much older time Frame. Sometimes some people enquire about old people who are dead, " Hi machaa, how are you? How's Gandhi, Nehru? Will India get independence this year? ". But I respected that part of him, he has some ideas about life and he lives by them under any circumstance.

He once called me out. Many people have approached me till date. He was decent. He asked for coffee together. I played a Bitch. I told I drink only beer. I very well know that would have hurt him. But I also know he is strong enough to take it. I was fearing. I was fearing that I would fall for him. 

Today I have called Sachin for a date. It took sometime for me to come over my fear. Or may be that I don't fear anymore because I have already fallen for him. 

Today is my birthday. He doesn't know about that. It would be a surprise, he love surprises. 

I shouldn't blow it up. I have to speak more. Speak my heart out, like he does always. Make him realise he is important. And then, things will fall into place. I believe in gravity. I believe in love.

Today is the day my friends. Today is the day.

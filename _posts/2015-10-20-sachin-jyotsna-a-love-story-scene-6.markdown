I wore red for a reason. I know he likes the color. Best part about him is, when he likes somebody wearing red, he openly acknowledges the person right in front of them. "I like the color. It looks good on you.", I remember him telling Shweta. 

I was doing random things restlessly on his car, and he kept observing silently. New for me. New for him. As he kept driving long, I interrupted him, "Are we going to Pondicherry?" 
He starred at my eyes.
I asked him again, "did you already inform Manoj about half day leave?"
He had a shakedown. "No. I should go back."
I continued, "well, if you keep driving without finding restaurant, we will reach Pondicherry"
He smiled. It was vibrant. 

We found a restaurant. They had a table for two. We went there and sat opposite to each other. Waiter brought a candle to the table. God screws all our plan. But when he gives back, its more than worth the plan. 

I ordered lasagna for me and he ordered chicken steak for him. I tried not showing hesitation, but he did figure out that I don't eat meat. He then converted his order into a barito. As i kept playing with plastic flower on the table, he broke the silence. "I am sorry. I screwed it up yesterday. I couldn't fix the bike soon." 
I was put in surprise. 
"It was Alan's laziness first. And then his bike's laziness. I couldn't help it. And when I had come late, you weren't there at our meeting spot. I dropped by at your home as well, looking for you. Did your mom tell you?"
I couldn't resist. I laughed out loudly. So loudly that, the child in table next to us started crying. He apologised to everyone, sat back, held my hand tightly and asked me to be quite. Took a while for me. That face full of ignorance! I started liking him more. "Should I tell this poor guy, what happened on my side?" I asked myself. "Don't tell him." Said my ego. I saved my story for future, for us to laugh at it.

We started going out everyday. He would come to me with some reason to go out everyday. "I hate my manager", " I hate my client ", "I am bored of sitting with computer ", "I am bored of machine coffee", " you are beautiful today ", " long day. I think i need a break ", " I need a break ", " I just need a break ". My answer would be simply. " OK let's go out for coffee ". Though people thought it was for coffee, zomato helped us roam out for good chat and dessert. 'Pani poori day', 'Pav bhajji day', 'kulfi day', 'cafe coffee day', 'brownie with ice cream day', 'caramel sundae', 'milk shake day', 'chaai day', 'green tea day'. It's not all. We started taking more breaks during work too. The many many coffee mugs people gifted me for all these days started helping us. Each break, we would go to different wings in our building with different coffee mugs.

Our relationship started to build over coffee. Life is becoming so beautiful all of a sudden.

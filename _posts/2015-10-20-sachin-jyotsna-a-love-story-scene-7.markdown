When magic happens, there is attention. People sleep until then, but become hyper active all of a sudden! More than the gravity I had over her, we both pulled people's eyes over us. We can only pretend that we are different people with different coffee mugs each time. Factually, the more we pretended, the more obvious it became! 

Managers are the most complicated human beings on earth. When we have just started our relationship over coffees, Manoj would have already named our kids in his imagination! If you show a flower at them, they will think in several dimensions before they act. "Flower might create a smell, the smell would bring attention of a few people there by reducing productivity and efficiency of his team. I should throw this flower out!". Or, like " somebody would use this flower to impress a girl in team. They will get married. The girl would quit her work. I should immediately throw away the flower ". Manoj was a very good friend earlier. But the managerial mask made him a ninja clown in the team. Well, he still thinks he is Ninja but we could only see a clown in him.

New mail from Manoj in outlook, ' Meeting, rush! '. " I should teach this guy some emotion sometime ", I told to myself. I rushed to his room. He was in all smiles. I knew something was wrong. "Sachin, our client, the MD of AVP, pvt. Ltd., is very happy with our cooperation. He has invited one of our colleagues to his industry for a workshop. It's an one month programme, which will help us build interpersonal skills, and strengthen our cooperation."
All of a sudden, Manoj turned blue and i saw a chakra spinning behind his head. "Krishna??!!"
The 'ever-interested' me showed my first disinterest in any offer at my company. "Sachin, I think you are the right person to represent us. You must go to Mumbai tomorrow."
 I wanted to ask him, "so tell me what's going on behind your head? Did I marry Jyotsna and she quits job after that?". 
He continued, " Don't worry Sachin! I would ask them to serve coffee regularly, since you have developed a taste for coffee recently ".
I rose my voice! " What's your problem Manoj? What's wrong in me drinking coffee? "
 " Well too much of caffeine is not good for health Sachin. Break is good for you. And for us."
I hate it, when I live a life where people find things in me to spin sarcasms over. I like to be transparent because when nothing is fishy in life, I can face the sarcastic people on their bloody face!
What's wrong if a guy and a girl goes out? They both have gravity by nature! Well well!! These fools are blind to nature, after all!!
"Well! I don't like this behaviour in you Manoj. But ya, I will go!"
This is another instant in my life, I was searching for the baddest words in every language I know. 

When I came out, Jyotsna came to desk. 
"Yet another bad meeting you survived! And you need a coffee now. Am I right?", in her tutty voice.
I lost all the thoughts. That was like how my dad, back from a long day at work, would react after seeing me when I was a kid. I reciprocated her emotion. We were drinking tea for a change. I kept rolling the tea bag on my cup. 

These are those few heavy moments in life where I feel," can this moment vanish?". I have to tell her that I am gonna go away for one full month. I will miss her! She will miss me too.

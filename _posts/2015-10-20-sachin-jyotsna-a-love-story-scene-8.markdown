May be it was too much coffee all of a sudden. He had to leave to Mumbai for a workshop. His face was literally down on the ground. "Aww you are so cute! Just go Sachin! Nothing is gonna happen in a month". He then smiled. 

I had gone to send him off. " How are you going to be in touch?" I asked him. He looked at my eyes for a while. 
"I will write letters!" He said with a smile.
"Are you kidding?"
"No I am not. Check your e-mail inbox. It would have an electronic letter each day. You could reply to that."
"You are mad Sachin."
"Not as mad as these ones" he pointed at a family who were waiting in airport, the man and the lady were drowned in their mobile phone and their kid was playing angry birds in a Tab. 
A warm hug. And then I watched him leave. It was indeed heavy. No wonder people used to say, 'airports are places which often see the true emotions'. 

His first mail after reaching Mumbai went like this, 
"Jyo! 
Reached mumbai! Journey was smooth. It's raining here and city looks sexy in the rain :) 

When I checked-in, first thing I ordered was a coffee. I am typing this mail taking sips on my coffee here. The smell of caffeine is so intimate that I can feel your presence around. 

Need to rest now. Long days are awaited.
Will miss you,
Sachin"
I asked mom to bring a coffee to my room. I prepared myself to write a reply. 
"Sachin,
Happy to hear from you. Don't take too much rest. Go explore the sexy Mumbai. New place and new people are the ones which excites you always. Though Mumbai isn't a new city for you, people would definitely be. Look for good Vada Pav chat spots. 

I wish there are some rains here too. Month of January and Chennai is showing a shade of summer. The coffee smell completes the void though :)
Missing you already,
Jyotsna"
So the coffee times gradually shifted from office to home. But my parents are the best people. If my mom asks for the second coffee powder packet in middle of the month, my father won't analyse if she is adding coffee powder in every dish she makes. My maid won't count the number of used tumblers from my room, when she picks them up for cleaning. 

Next day I had to wait for his mail till late night. And then I received a mail with one pdf attachment. 
"Hi Jyo,
Sorry for making you wait. I read all 10 mails that you had sent in mean time. 
I felt writing was more organic than typing. It took a while for me to make the scanner at my hotel to work with my tab. 
PFA my letter for today :)

Till next time,
Sachin"
This guy is mad! 

He had an elaborate letter. His hand writing made me go crazy at times, "I should buy some cursive writing books to him". But his writing was as open as his speech. His words were as emotional as the tone of his voice. I was missing him. There was some pain, but I was loving it.

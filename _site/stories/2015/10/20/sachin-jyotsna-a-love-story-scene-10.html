          <p>I must have told him long back. At least I must have told him in person. I saved the story to be told and laughed at, together. Not for this. I didn&#39;t hear from him after the day I mailed him what happened on my birthday. </p>

<p>Life became hollow all of a sudden. Walking on the street, I felt like I am alone, standing in the middle of sub-way with so many people around. I wrote so many mails. I flooded his office mail box too. He didn&#39;t reply. There is always one person I can run into, at any kind of crisis in life. Appa :) . He read my eyes. He didn&#39;t talk about it. Wherever I am down, he immediately takes me out. Just him and me. We walked in the sea without speaking a word. Even if everybody in the world would fail, there would be one person who would be waiting for me with open shoulders, and that&#39;s my dad! </p>

<p>I figured out it was Feb 14 the next day. City was all red. Balloons, lights, decorations, all in red. Bessie was flooded by couples. &#39;Out&#39; wasn&#39;t working great. Dad tried food. Murugan idly kadai and its wonderful idlys. I filled my stomach. Still didn&#39;t work. Father took me home. Mom prepared coffee, still didn&#39;t work. She then cleaned my room up and set the bed up ready. I wanted to check my mail box once. No mails from him. I rushed to my bed, locked my room, cuddled up my pillow and slept tight. </p>

<p>My mobile woke me up. I answered the call. &quot;Jyo!&quot; The same warm voice. It was him. It was him. &quot;Sachin?&quot;
&quot;Ya it&#39;s me. Can you get ready? I will pick you up in 1 hour from the fifth Street.&quot;
I cried. Out of happiness. Most wonderful moment. I was excited as much as a school kid would be on first day of the summer long vacation. I got ready. The Tyndall effect at the window curtain, agarbatti fragrance from mom&#39;s pooja room, sulamangalam sister&#39;s voices singing kanda shashti kavasam in surround. Just the kind of fresh start to the day i could ever get. Was hyper excited in dine table. Kissed mom. Hugged dad. Ran to fifth Street. Sachin was already waiting in his car. I went and sat in. We both looked each other. He said &quot;Hi&quot;. I said &quot; Hi!&quot;. The eyes spoke the rest. I gave him a hug. It lasted for little more than half a minute. He asked me, &quot;Shall we go?&quot;. I was speechless. &quot; Yes!&quot;.</p>

<p>He drove me towards ECR. I asked him, &quot;Your workshop is over?&quot;.
He said, &quot;No&quot;. 
&quot; What??? Then how come in Chennai?&quot;
&quot;Long story short, just wanted to meet you once&quot;
&quot;You are a magician!&quot; I smiled. He was indeed the magician. I couldn&#39;t see him. I thought I would cry. I kept staring outside window, loving the breeze and sun, like the first vacation trip for a school kid. </p>

<p>He took me to a private beach. I have been there once, when I was 12 years old. With my dad. He stopped the car, came out running, opened the door for me, like a servant, like I am his queen. I went out, straight to the beach. He parked the car and followed me. I was flying high. Wanted to settle down. Watched the sea, and the sun light sparkling over bay of Bengal. Then I realised he was hiding something behind. I asked him what. 
&quot;Happy belated birthday.&quot; It was a bouquet with 23 roses in it. My cheeks weakened. Eyes got wet. &quot;These 23 roses are for the 23 beautiful years you have made this world look beautiful.&quot; I took the bouquet from him. He gave another single rose. &quot;This rose is for the next 40 days, for this stupid making it late&quot;. I cried. I hugged him. The sun, the sea, and him. This time the hug lasted for more than a few minutes. Then I was holding his hand and staring at the sea and thanking God for giving this wonderful moment. The world was looking like, as if it is existing only for us. </p>

<p>We then did everything spontaneously. &quot;Pasta&quot; I would say, and we would go for Italian cuisine restaurant. &quot;Bowling&quot; he would say, we went to play bowling in Mall. &quot;Ice-colo&quot; I would say, we would go to the kulfi shop. We lived the day like living a whole life together. Then he said, &quot;I have to board my flight in night. So I would drop you home now.&quot; The sun was falling and it started to rain. There was traffic. &quot;Sachin? Some music?&quot; I asked him. &quot;Ya sure. Open the CD book and play the 4th disk&quot;. It was written Raja Sir Volume 3. First song was &#39;Oh butterfly&#39;. Rain. Evening. Traffic. That song. Me and Him. &quot;Thanks a lot traffic, please extend this journey&quot;</p>

<p>We were near my house. He said, &quot;Well! I hope you are happy. Sorry for not replying for your mails. We will meet again.&quot; 
&quot;When?&quot;
&quot;Soon. Just couple more weeks.&quot;
Silence. I was very happy. But there was some incompleteness.
&quot;Bye&quot; he whispered. 
&quot;Bye&quot;. 
I got out of the car. He pulled me back into the car and whispered, &quot; 9486075474&quot;. 
&quot;You have got a phone?&quot;
&quot;Yes!&quot; He showed his phone.
Best possible gift! He is changed. He diluted his principles in life for me. He has stepped in a few miles closer today. For me. He managed to surprise me, despite being very far. His eyes had a gravity, which made me fly. First gravity in world to disprove newton&#39;s law. It was Love! At its purest form. </p>

<p>As I was looking into his eyes, it rained again. It locked me up in car again. Now I had a gravitational pull towards him. He came closer to me. I allowed him to come closer. There was exchange of breathe. There was exchange of heat. Our heart beats synchronised. 
And then, we Kissed!!</p>

          <p>I blew it up. How am I gonna face her tomorrow? At least I must have taken my car. I mean, what is about this bike thing? Why are girls so obsessed with bikes. </p>

<p>Alan totally twisted the day. I thought he was one of the very few trustworthy friends. But he is indeed trustworthy. I missed a point. My friends!! If you ever ask for a favour from somebody, ask from the one who isn&#39;t lazy. Even if he isn&#39;t trustworthy, that&#39;s OK. Because laziness is mother of all evil. Laziness can anyday win over trustworthiness. And screw up your day completely.</p>

<p>It was 2:30pm already. I lost hopes on him and i rushed to his place, only to find him on his couch, sleeping peacefully. I was thinking of any ridiculous way to wake him. The TV was on, but was on mute. I took the remote and immediately increased the volume to maximum. He fell off the bed and wiped his eyes several times. Before he could recognise me, he started his hilarious reasons. &quot;machaan, I had kept alarm. But the mobile got switched off without power.&quot; Every now and then people get me on nerves, but only on a few occasions, they get to see the reddish nerves popping out of my eyes. It was one of those occasions. He continued, &quot;machaan, I anticipated this and I had informed my mom to remind me as well.&quot; I spoke, &quot;where is your mom?&quot; She entered the house carrying a bag full of groceries, &quot;hey Sachin, when did you come? He didn&#39;t tell me that you would come.&quot; I was burning him with my eyes. His mom continued, &quot;nevertheless, please come and have lunch. I have made chicken. This guy is sleeping the whole day. You don&#39;t wait for him&quot;.</p>

<p>Before Alan was ashes, he took me to his parking shed. Gorgeous classic 350 was standing on its side stand. Like a boss! His wrangler helmet went so well with my aviator. I tried sitting on it and i was feeling Swag. When i drove out of his house it was 3:10pm. &quot;She must be already in 5th street waiting for me near the bakery.&quot; My thoughts tightened me up. I was losing control. I made her wait for me. </p>

<p>These were the very few occasions I had ever felt I am being too idealistic. &quot;I think I should get a phone.&quot; I was already late. I thought I should pass on a message to her saying I am late. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with this city? Where are those beautiful telephone booths with which Ajith and Devayani romanced in their times??&quot; The road was empty enough for me to touch 80s. &quot;I thank you God!! For emptying this road&quot; And then, something happened. The bike was slowing down. </p>

<p>Friends!! If you would ever borrow a bike from a friend on emergencies, borrow a familiar one. &quot;What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you stop, bloody?&quot; I kept kicking the starter pedal , &quot;awww common, why aren&#39;t you starting now??&quot;. The roads are empty. &quot;I don&#39;t thank you God! For emptying the road!!&quot; I then made a choice to push and roll the classic 350 and walk a bit until my eyes spots any ray of hope. &quot;I hate you God!!&quot; Like God was listening to me over a wireless, he responded so fast! </p>

<p>It was a mechanic shop. When the mechanic guy came out, I spotted a glow of light in the back of his head. &quot;Now how do I explain him what went wrong in this bloody bike? I frankly have no idea&quot;. I was collecting words and breaking my voice. 
&quot; No problem Sir. Naan paathukuren &quot; he was God. He was simply God. He kicked the pedal several times too, &quot;well, then I did it correctly. The problem is actually with bike &quot; I has a sigh of relief. </p>

<p>He had a mobile phone. This time, i planned to ask God his mobile phone. &quot;Can I borrow your phone Need to make an important call!&quot; He treated me like his boss. He is God after all. When I opened my phone book, her number was written in legible and bold letter. God peeped into my phone book and read the name. He asked me, &quot;Yaar Sir? Unga figuraa?&quot; He is not God! He is definitely not god. There was a thirst in his eyes when he asked like that. I gave him his mobile without the call. </p>

<p>It was 4:30 when the bike was ready. I know the day is gone. I know I blew it up. But I wanted to drive to the fifth street anyway. I expected, she might be waiting inspite of the time delays. That&#39;s what happens in all Tamil films. When I reached our meeting spot, she wasn&#39;t there. &quot;Tamil film directors!! You never spin a story close to reality&quot;. A part of my mind told me to go to her home. Another part told me not to go. In these 50-50 scenarios, our gravity is naturally towards the 50 which will spoil the scene. I went to her home with the last hopes. There were a lot of relatives at her place. Her mom told she had gone out. &quot;I burn Alan after I am ashes myself tomorrow!&quot;. Her mom was kind, she noted my name. She might tell her that I at least came late. That might reduce the after effects tomorrow. </p>

<p>This is one of those few Sundays I hated! And tomorrow is one of those deadly Mondays. This time, it&#39;s not manager, client, but her.</p>

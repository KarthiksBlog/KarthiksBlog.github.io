          <p>I think I am unlucky. He is a gentleman. He had a respect over me. I think I lost it completely today. </p>

<p>Relatives play an important role in spoiling all our plans. Right from our childhood. &quot;Relatives, please change your name as spoilers&quot;. My father wanted to buy a bullet. He was crazy about royal Enfield, he still is. If you ask him to choose between a bullet and Rolls Royce he would go for bullet. &quot;It&#39;s just the kingmanship&quot;, he keeps saying. He used to tell me stories about his 20s. He was saving money to buy a bullet. He waited for 3-4 years to save enough money to buy one bullet. He apparently made an order too. That was simply the time when his uncle visited home with my mom&#39;s horoscope. You know what the fate is, he hasn&#39;t got his bullet yet.</p>

<p>When I was in my 9th grade, my father decided to put me in an international school in ooty. I was thoroughly excited. In summer break after 8th grade, my father had taken me to ooty. The school was excellent. The weather was too good. The toy train track was right next to our school campus. They had student body theatre club. Sound of train, misty weather, theatre club, those were just the three things I was longing for years! And then, just a couple of weeks before I start my schooling in ooty, mala Aunty had come home. She isn&#39;t my mom&#39;s sister, she is my life spoiler. Have you read the book by Varun Agarwal? She is simply the Anu Aunty. In two hours, she proved to my parents that my later school in Chennai was 10 times better than my dream school in ooty. She had even brought her kid and made him perform aasanaas in front of my whole family, to impress them with yoga they teach in my later school. &quot;I say you today, lady with big red torch light on forehead, I am counting on your spoilers and i will give you back every single one in future&quot; I used to say to myself, everytime she is home. But the counter is overflowing. And I am helplessly and hopelessly waiting for day to give her back.</p>

<p>Yet again, she is the one who spoiled it totally today. Friends!! If any of your relatives are doing MLM business, please be double aware of them. I was getting ready. Sachin was everywhere in my mind. And that&#39;s when she arrived home, yet again in 11th hour, yet again with spoiler bombs!! </p>

<p>Wherever she is home, I can know that she is home much before I could see her. As soon as she enters our home, the place will be set to silence, the silence you could probably find only at places like Antarctica centre or top of Himalayas. A strange loud deafening noise will break the silence. &quot;Haaaiiii puppyyyy&quot;. She calls my mom puppy. Some day my father would possibly run and jump out of compound wall, due to the trauma of her frightening voice. </p>

<p>She had brought white &quot; Dappaas&quot; of various sizes. &quot;Puppy, look at the new entrepreneur!!&quot;. My father looked at her back with expression of expecting someone. Only both of us know that, everytime he deliberately does that! &quot; ohh Maheshh! I am the new entrepreneur &quot;. My heart was broken into as many pieces as the number of &quot; dabbaas&quot; she had brought. I knew she is going to start with some marketing demonstration. If I go to somebody&#39;s home, I wouldn&#39;t start by boasting. &#39;how are you&#39; would be my first words. Mala Aunty always starts with boasting. &quot;My day is screwed! Totally!&quot; My pulse rate raised! </p>

<p>Do you guys watch cricket? I watch test matches with my dad! He loves watching it with me. Her entrance was like India bowled out completely with the last wicket tail ender pair batting on 5th day of an away test match! Only rain could save the match! &quot;God save me!&quot; I whispered. She was in the middle of her boasting about the MLM business she is been doing recently. My father wanted to find a way to relieve me.
&quot;Hey saleslady!&quot;, my father went on calling Mala Aunty in his tonic voice.
&quot;How rude Mahesh!&quot;, my mom interfered. 
&quot; Oh then how should I call you ?&quot;
Mala Aunty spoke, &quot;call me business girl Mahesh&quot;. 
&quot; If you are a girl, then what is Jyotsna?&quot; My dad read my mind.
&quot;Aww she is still &#39;namma kozhantha&#39; (our very own kid) na&quot;
&quot;Alright business girl, our kid should go out now&quot;
&quot;Why??&quot; She screamed.
The one thing I hate about my father was that, he doesn&#39;t know to lie! &quot;Today is her birthday and she is going out with friends&quot;, he answered her like the 11th man opened up all three sticks to the pace bowler. 
&quot;Oh my God... Kozhantha... It&#39;s your birthday today?? How can you leave  athai and go out? I will cook some sweet for you. You must stay.&quot; Mala Aunty and my mom on one side. Me and my father on other side. Mom wins over father and so, we lost the last wicket too.</p>

<p>Time was already 3, when they went to the kitchen. I could have still escaped. But once when I had done like that early, mum did a big drama of not eating food. &quot;He is punctual. He must have arrived by now.&quot;  She cooked some weird pale pinky dish which she called herself a apple cake. They made me cut it. My father took photographs. It was around 5. My faces were like, how I used to hold my piss during long afternoon classes after lunch break during my 6th grade. She continued to brain wash my mom and dad with her MLM. My father interrupted, &quot;Priya, at least now we should let her go.&quot; My mom nodded her head up and down. &quot;I love you pa&quot;, I kissed him and ran out of the place. &quot; Jyo...&quot; screamed the Mala Aunty. &quot;I will come next Sunday and give you one separate session. You should join us. You know, you can earn when you are studying only.&quot; 
and my father interrupted, &quot;she is done with her studies and she is working now&quot; . 
&quot;Oh aamaa la... Ok go...&quot;
I was Indian of year 1947.
&quot;Jyooo...&quot; She again screamed. 
&quot;Huh Aunty&quot; like a sudden heavy vehicle break on highway.
&quot;You should not go out with guys, OK?&quot; She is a witch. None other than a witch.
&quot;Okay Aunty&quot; this time I planned to shut my ear drums off and run like deer. </p>

<p>Fifth Street was empty. So much empty as my heart was. &quot;I can&#39;t handle this, God why did you do this to me???&quot; Nervousness lowered down my blood pressure. Vision darkened. &quot;He must have waited for long. I made the gentleman wait. I hate myself.&quot;  There was only one person on earth I would run to at scenarios like this. My dad. I wanted to come back home. But I was not interested to meet the witch.</p>

<p>I went to my friend&#39;s place. We went to cafe near by and celebrated my birthday over a slice of black forest. I hated the day. The birthdays should begin well for the year to be well throughout. But this birthday was sick.</p>

<p>I had come back home late in the night. &quot;Jyoo, your colleague by the name Sachin had come home.&quot;, my mom said. I was freezed to silence. You know, that&#39;s most wounding moment. He had come, he had waited in fifth Street patiently. He had come home later looking for me. I felt like a Bitch. &quot; No Sachin, I am not a Bitch &quot; i sounded to myself. </p>

<p>Mondays are generally haunting. But there was one person named Sachin who used to turn them around. Now the reason behind is Sachin himself. I feel like a Bitch. How am I gonna face him tomorrow?</p>

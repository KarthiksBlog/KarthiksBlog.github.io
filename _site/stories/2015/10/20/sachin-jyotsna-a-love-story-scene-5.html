          <p>I missed my alarm. As usual! But Thiru didn&#39;t! Thiru won&#39;t. &quot;Ende Bhaagyam!!&quot; I used to say to myself, wherever I wonder Thiru is my Room-mate. And he is best in waking me from sleep,. &quot;Well, he is second best, he is only after my mom.&quot; It&#39;s Monday!!!!</p>

<p>I had something close to fear of death, which drove me crazy. My body temperature was raising and falling like all 4 seasons are happening in me every half hour. But I wanted to meet her. For the first time in life, I was happy to run towards my fear. What a mixed feeling it is! </p>

<p>Well, everytime i am disappointed, I show it on my car. Yesterday, I had kicked him right on his bonnet. I was afraid if he would refuse to start. I have an emotional connection with my car. I went to him, keyed him on. Before trying on starter, I went like &quot;Lakshmi! Start aaidu ma&quot;. In memory of thalaivar from movie padikkaathavan. My Lakshmi did start on first attempt. In memory of bay of Bengal, Chennai people are working on a new variety of traffic each day. You cannot move, until you learn to swim. But it took only half the usual time to reach office. &quot; When I am hoping for some good to happen in life, you screw my bike and my day. But when I am hoping for a deadly encounter, you can even dilute Chennai traffic in peak hour. God! You are marvellous!!&quot;, I looked up with my nerves carrying the blood full of sarcasm. I walked towards my cubicle. &quot;She hasn&#39;t come yet!!&quot;. I used to have a sigh of relief of living an extra day, whenever my history teacher in school used to postpone the distribution of exam papers. That feeling was back in life. &quot;A few more minutes before you die&quot;, I told to myself.</p>

<p>It was 9am. My reminder in outlook popped up with message &quot; Book tatkal for mom and dad&quot;. Mata IRCTC ! It&#39;s time to fight for her darshan!!! To book a tatkal ticket in India, you have to follow three rules. 1. Patience, and falling down head over heals to Mata IRCTC 2. Patience, even after you fail 3. Patience, like you are about to attain motksha. I go to the corner of my campus with my tab, the only place where my data connection will show some mercy.  </p>

<p>Thiru is our godfather, he is the only person from our friends circle who can understand every bit about Mata. He knows shortcuts so that he can confirm his birth, when half of us would fail to get even a waiting list ticket. When we all assemble 10 minutes early, he comes in front of computer at 9:30 to book a single ticket. &quot;That 20 minutes gap between him and us, i call it dedication and discipline&quot;. </p>

<p>It was about to get 10am. When you are logged in inside irctc, she didn&#39;t like you disturbing her often, nor not disturbing her. So you should master the number of times you are gonna disturb her. More than that, you need to master yourself to wait for her reactions. It was 10:00:00am. I was excited. I clicked &quot; load trains &quot;. She kept rolling her eyes, Mata is known for that. After 5 minutes, I lost my patience. I clicked &quot; load trains &quot; one more time. She through me out! Right away! &#39;You have either pressed back button or forward button or both. To re-login, please click here&#39;. What is that in the whole world!! These are the only possible options! Even Super Mario gives you an opportunity to start from any level where mario dies, but not irctc! Mata asks you to re-login freshly again!! Incoming mail, it was Thiru. &quot;Hey da! Booking confirmed. PFA&quot;. Thiru, is simply our godfather!!! He owes a bit higher respect to that of father, from all of us! One more mail. It was my manager this time. &quot; Client meeting. Rush &quot;, he writes mail like sms. You can&#39;t figure out his mood. So, in all chances, you have to rush to his room. I did rush. And then the meeting went on for half day. It was one of many many meetings I survived, which could have been better conveyed with a single mail.</p>

<p>I was getting back, hunger was beginning to eat me. And then, I saw Jyotsna. &quot; Well here it is! Go face her. You can! Tell her the truth. It&#39;s going to be alright! &quot; That&#39;s simply how I face things in life.  </p>

<p>She was smiling. It was like a Raja sir song. Her eyes were so bright and complimenting. It was like the counter pointing bass line Raja sir uses. She was wearing a red saree. It was flying in air like Raja sir&#39;s strings composition. &quot;Raja Sir, kolreengale!!!&quot; I tapped over my chest. I lost the fear totally! 
&quot;You are so beautiful!&quot;, I said. She looked at me with surprise. I felt like Vaali Sir wrote all those songs for me. There was an external silence with internal storm. I wanted to keep the silence. It was beautiful! Both of us kept the silence for a while. Then I broke it as usual. 
&quot;I am hungry&quot;.<br>
&quot;Ok, let&#39;s go out for lunch&quot;, she said.
I didn&#39;t want to talk one bit more. Wherever gives me a chance to make up, I do it strongly. 
&quot;Shall I call people to join us?&quot;, that would have been the stupidest of the questions I would ask her. She remained silent. 
&quot;Okay, you wait here. I will get keys from Alan&quot;.
&quot; Don&#39;t you have your car?? &quot; She whispered. 
&quot;Well, yes. Yes! We shall go. Let&#39;s go. Please come.&quot; </p>

<p>Man! This is simply awesome. This feeling. This silence. I feel the butterflies. Alan calls it &quot;Butterfly effect: a butterfly&#39;s effect&quot;. There was nervousness outside. But my inner self was at peace, total peace! I loved these kind of mixed emotions. I felt like each word I drop here would spoil the scene like drops of paint over clear water. I remained silent. She sat on my car in the front, adjusted ac and tuned FM. She was as if she was owning my car. I loved that freedom in her when she was with me.</p>

<p>Monday, I love you! For probably first time in life!</p>
